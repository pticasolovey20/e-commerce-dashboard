## :wave: Hi everyone :alien: 

#### This is my project where I'm trying out best practices that I've learned or am learning while doing this project.
I found a layout I liked, and I will try to implement it in React + TypeScript

##### Goals for this project:
- To improve skills in using the MUI :monocle_face:
- Get more practice with TypeScript :fist_left:
- More practice with React :nerd_face:
- To solidify practice with Redux Toolkit in conjunction with TypeScript :rocket:
- Possibly get to know other tools for implementing authorization (not only Firebase) :weight_lifting_woman:
- And, of course, to learn about new libraries :books:
